# Week One Challenge: HTML, CSS, and Git - Code Refactor

## Project Overview

This project aims to ensure that our website adheres to accessibility standards, enhancing both user experience and search engine optimization (SEO). By implementing semantic HTML elements, maintaining a logical structure, and using accessible attributes, we ensure that our site is navigable and understandable for all users, including those using assistive technologies.

### User Story

SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

### Acceptance Criteria

```

THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
